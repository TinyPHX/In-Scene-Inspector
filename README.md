## Installation

Once your download is complete you should have a file named in-scene-inspector-v#.unitypackage. This can then be imported into Unity:
1. From the unity top menu select "Assets" > "Import Package" > "Custom Package..."
2. Find the ".unitypackage" file and click open once selected
3. Confirm that the folder "In Scene Inspector" has been added directly under your Unity "Asset" folder.

## Usage

Once you've got everything downloaded and installed you should have the following folder struction under your Unity "Assets" folder:
>  Scene Inspector
     Images - Images used to style the inspector. These can be directly replaced (at least in the beta) although it would be appreciated if the ISI logo is included somewhere.
   > Prefabs
       Field Types - Prefabs used in generated interface for members of certain variable types. 
       Widgets - Extra functionality required by ISI included in the form of widgets. 
     Scripts - DLL containing all needed scripts used by ISI.

### Using Prefabs

There are 2 prefabs included in the "Prefabs" folder.

* In Scene Inspector - All in one solution including UI canvas, event system, and Inspector Panel.
* Inspector Panel - The panel only. This is the core and all that is required for full functionality. 

#### Canvas Settings
